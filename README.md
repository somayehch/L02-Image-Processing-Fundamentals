# 🎞️ 📷 🌌 Image Processing Fundamentals

This repository contains my **Google Colab notebook** exploring the fundamentals of **Image Processing**.  
It’s part of my journey into **Artificial Intelligence** at HCC, using practical exercises to understand how images are transformed and prepared for more advanced vision tasks.
