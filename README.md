# 🌟 Computer Vision Projects 🌟

Welcome to my **Computer Vision journey** 💻👁️  
This repo started as part of my *Image Processing Fundamentals* course 📚, and now it has grown into my personal space for exploring and learning about images, machine learning, and vision projects 🚀✨  

---

## 📂 Contents

- 📘 **L3_A.ipynb** – class exercise notebook  
- 📘 **L3_B.ipynb** – class exercise notebook  
- 🐱🐶🚢 **cifar10_svm_scikit_learn.ipynb** – image classification on CIFAR-10 (cats, dogs, ships) using Scikit-Learn (SVM)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repo or download the notebooks ⬇️  
2. Install the dependencies 🛠️  
   ```bash
   
   pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn
   
✨ Highlights

🎨 Preprocessing images: grayscale, normalize, flatten

📊 Training Linear SVM and evaluating results

🐱 Cats and 🐶 dogs are tricky to classify, but 🚢 ships are easier!

💡 Learned how to fix slow training by using smaller samples and PCA



🔮 Coming Soon

Here are some ideas I’m working on (so check back later 😉):

🖼️ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for better accuracy

🎭 Image Augmentation tricks (flips, rotations, crops)

🔍 Feature extraction with HOG or deep embeddings

🎮 Maybe even a fun game with computer vision (stay tuned!)



💖 Notes

This repo shows both my class work 🏫 and my personal practice 🔬.

I’ll keep adding more notebooks as I learn new techniques in Computer Vision.



Stay tuned! 🌈

🧩 Fun Section for You

Want to test yourself? Try answering:

🤔 Why is it harder to classify cats and dogs than ships?

🔎 What is the difference between SVC and LinearSVC?

🧠 How could CNNs improve results compared to SVMs?

(Answers are in the notebooks — explore and find out!)
